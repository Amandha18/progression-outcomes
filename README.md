# Predicting Progression Outcome 
<p>This is a python CLI application that allows the user to predict their progression outcome at the end of each academic year.</p>
<p>The program have 3 versions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>student version</li>
  <li>staff version</li> 
  <li>staff version with dictionary</li>
 </ul>
<p>As an extension, the staff version of the program was created allowing the staff member to predict the progression outcome of many students and view their outcome summary in a horizontal histogram and an option to save it in a text file.</p>
<p>The staff version with dictionary is a seperate program which allows the staff member to add the student ID, and predict the progression outcome. Which will be saved into a dictionary.</p>
